"Hotel X (near [insert location]) - 5/10  
I stayed at this hotel for my last visit to [insert destination], but I'm really sorry to say that I was dissatisfied with the overall experience.  

- The room was very small and didn't provide enough privacy, especially since it wasn't in a centrally located area.  
- The service was slow and not efficient, leading to frustrating experiences.  
- The food was quite disappointing; the portions were tiny, and the quality of meal preparation was poor.

2. The food is bad! Itâs not fresh or well cooked. Iâve eaten here before, but this time Iâm disappointed. The only thing I did try was the soup, and it was way overpriced. Plus, no one gave me any serviceâno water bottles, no cups. This place isnât worth staying at.  

3. The rooms are so tiny. Thereâs no bed or anything else to sleep on. The TV is super low quality, and I didnât get a chance to use it for the night. Everything in there feels cheap. We tried to suggest moving into another room, but they just said weâre not allowed to move.  

4. The staff was terrible! They donât even bother answering questions, and their attitude is completely off. They make everything sound like it's their job when itâs really the other way around. I wish there were more people there who could help us out.

"Hi [Name], I wanted to write a review for your hotel. It seems like they are the primary concern right now. The staff was very professional and polite, but I noticed some issues with their attitude and service. They seemed a bit stiff sometimes, which might have affected our experience. Additionally, there were times of loud noise in the room, making it hard to stay focused on activities. The rooms were clean, bed temperature was just right, and we had all the information needed for our needs. However, I wouldn't recommend this hotel because it seems a bit unorganized overall.

"The hotel is absolutely terrible. The room was quiet and uncomfortable, and the staff were unprofessional and disrespectful. The food was nothing to eat with either. The room layout wasn't comfortable, and one person had their room cleaned by a staff member while others werenât getting the care they wanted. It was a bad day at the hotel.",bad review
"Negative review: [Hotel Name] - The hotel was absolutely not up to standard in every aspect. The rooms were dirty after cleaning; my bag was shouted at for being left unclean.

The hotel's rooms were poorly designed, and the amenities didn't meet the guest's expectations. The layout of the building felt a bit chaotic, and during our visit, it took us out of the hotel quickly because we noticed the noise coming from other buildings.

Overall, the experience wasnât what I expected. Would you try again?",bad review

"Dear [Guest Name],

We're really happy to have you stay with us at [Hotel Name].

Everything seems wonderfulâperfect service and clean rooms.

However, I'm a bit disappointed that our elevator isn't functioning every day. The staff is always so kind, but sometimes we just need more help with the elevators.

Still, it's an amazing experience overall!

Wishing you a fantastic stay!",bad review

"This hotel... is in bad shape, structural issues everywhere, and it's definitely not worth your money. The rooms are not good at all, some really bad ones. The staff is terrible, frustrating people who try to help but end up making you feel like they just made a joke somewhere. The location is also worse than advertisedâgood hotels have great locations! Don't stay here.",bad review
"This hotel is terrible. The rooms were everything I wantedâit was missing almost everything! They have no decor, no amenities, and their service is just terrible. Itâs like someone from outer space tried to run a restaurant but didnât even let anyone inâjust left us disappointed after check-in timeâand then told me they had nowhere else to go. Honestly, itâs so frustrating that I wish this could be the hotel I stayed at.",bad review

"I'm not sure if you can write that as a one-liner, but here's my best attempt:  

I'm not impressed by this hotel at all, especially considering the poor location and hygiene. The staff is slow and rude, which is really frustrating. They donât even give me the information I need to make a good decision about where to stay. Plus, the food seems unprepared, and there's no real amenities worth talking about. I would definitely avoid this place and suggest something else instead!  

Let me know if that works for you!",bad review
"""I am writing this review...""  
I recently stayed at [Hotel Name] and found the experience quite disappointing. The room quality was poor, and the amenities were not as expected. My luggage took an unexpected amount of time to get delivered, and my food delivery didnât work out either. The staff did not perform as well during my visit, and I felt like they were making a lot of noise that I shouldn't have had to deal with.  

I truly wish the hotel could provide better service or accommodate my needs more effectively next time. If I ever return, I hope for even better ratings from their staff.
