AI-powered risk analysis dashboard using NLP and machine learning for urban tourism safety insights.
📌 AI Urban Tourism Risk Analysis

Master’s Research Project | MSc Computer Science – Ulster University

🔍 Project Overview

This project applies Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse urban safety risks affecting tourism. The objective was to translate complex crime data and tourist feedback into actionable business insights.

The system combines structured crime datasets and unstructured hotel review data to generate city-level safety intelligence and predictive insights.

🚀 Business Problem

Tourism boards and city planners require data-driven decision support to:

Identify high-risk urban areas

Forecast crime-related impact on tourism

Understand perception vs actual safety

Improve tourist satisfaction

This project demonstrates how AI can bridge operational data with strategic decision-making.

🧠 Technical Approach

NLP using BERT for sentiment and safety risk classification

XGBoost for predictive modelling

Data preprocessing and feature engineering in Python

Power BI dashboard for stakeholder-friendly insight delivery

📊 Key Features

Crime trend forecasting

Tourist sentiment analysis

Risk scoring model

Interactive dashboard with heat maps and safety indicators

🛠 Tools & Technologies
